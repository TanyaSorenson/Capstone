       " '\\nDuring these days of ceaseless conflict, anxiety and unrest among\\nmen, when at times it begins to look as if \"the Caucasian\" really is\\n\"played out,\" perhaps the English-reading world will turn with a sigh\\nof relief to the contemplation of wild animals. At all events, the\\nauthor has found this diversion in his favorite field mentally\\nagreeable and refreshing.',\n",
       " 'In comparison with some of the alleged men who now are cursing this\\nearth by their baneful presence, the so-called \"lower animals\" do not\\nseem so very \"low\" after all! As a friend of the animals, this is a\\nvery proper time in which to compare them with men. Furthermore, if\\nthinking men and women desire to know the leading facts concerning the\\nintelligence of wild animals, it will be well to consider them now,\\nbefore the bravest and the best of the wild creatures of the earth go\\ndown and out under the merciless and inexorable steam roller that we\\ncall Civilization.',\n",
       " 'The intelligence and the ways of wild animals are large subjects.\\nConcerning them I do not offer this volume as an all-in-all production.\\nOut of the great mass of interesting things that might\\nhave been included, I have endeavored to select and set forth only\\nenough to make a good series of sample exhibits, without involving the\\ngeneral reader in a hopelessly large collection of details. The most\\nserious question has been: What shall be left out?',\n",
       " 'Mr. A. R. Spofford, first Librarian of Congress, used to declare that\\n\"Books are made from books\"; but I call the reader to bear witness that\\nthis volume is not a mass of quotations. A quoted authority often can\\nbe disputed, and for this reason the author has found considerable\\nsatisfaction in relying chiefly upon his own testimony.',\n",
       " 'Because I always desire to know the _opinions_ of men who are\\nwriting upon their own observations, I have felt free to express my own\\nconclusions regarding the many phases of animal intelligence as their\\nmanifestation has impressed me in close-up observations.',\n",
       " 'I have purposely avoided all temptations to discuss the minds and\\nmanners of domestic animals, partly because that is by itself a large\\nsubject, and partly because their minds have been so greatly influenced\\nby long and close association with man. The domestic mammals and birds\\ndeserve independent treatment.',\n",
       " 'A great many stories of occurrences have been written into this\\nvolume, for the purpose of giving the reader all the facts in\\norder that he may form his own opinions of the animal mentality\\ndisplayed.',\n",
       " \"Most sincerely do I wish that the boys and girls of America, and of the\\nwhole world, may be induced to believe that _the most interesting\\nthing about a wild animal is its mind and its reasoning,_ and that a\\ndead animal is only a poor decaying thing. If the feet of the young men\\nwould run more to seeing and studying the wild creatures and less to\\nthe killing of them, some of the world's valuable species might escape\\nbeing swept away tomorrow, or the day after.\",\n",

       " '\\nThere is a vast field of fascinating human interest, lying only just\\noutside our doors, which as yet has been but little explored. It is the\\nField of Animal Intelligence.',\n",
       " \"Of all the kinds of interest attaching to the study of the world's\\nwild animals, there are none that surpass the study of their minds,\\ntheir morals, and the acts that they perform as the results of their\\nmental processes.\",\n",
       " 'In these pages, the term \"animal\" is not used in its most common\\nand most restricted sense. It is intended to apply not only to\\nquadrupeds, but also to all the vertebrate forms,--mammals,\\nbirds, reptiles, amphibians and fishes.',\n",
       " 'For observation and study, the whole vast world of living\\ncreatures is ours, throughout all zones and all lands. It is not\\nours to flout, to abuse, or to exterminate as we please. While for\\npractical reasons we do not here address ourselves to the\\ninvertebrates, nor even to the sea-rovers, we can not keep them\\nout of the background of our thoughts. The living world is so vast\\nand so varied, so beautiful and so ugly, so delightful and so\\nterrible, so interesting and so commonplace, that each step we\\nmake through it reveals things different and previously unknown.',\n",
       " \"The Frame of Mind. To the inquirer who enters the field of animal\\nthought with an open mind, and free from the trammels of egotism\\nand fear regarding man's place in nature, this study will prove an\\nendless succession of surprises and delights. In behalf of the\\nutmost tale of results, the inquirer should summon to his aid his\\nrules of evidence, his common sense, his love of fair play, and\\nthe inexorable logic of his youthful geometry.\",\n",
       " 'And now let us clear away a few weeds from the entrance to our\\nfield, and reveal its cornerstones and boundary lines. To a\\ncorrect understanding of any subject a correct point of view is\\nabsolutely essential.',\n",
       " \"In a commonplace and desultory way man has been mildly interested\\nin the intelligence of animals for at least 30,000 years. The Cro-\\nMagnons of that far time possessed real artistic talent, and on\\nthe smooth stone walls and ceilings of the caves of France they\\ndrew many wonderful pictures of mammoths, European bison, wild\\ncattle, rhinoceroses and other animals of their period. Ever since\\nman took unto himself certain tractable wild animals, and made\\nperpetual thralls of the horse, the dog, the cat, the cattle,\\nsheep, goats and swine, he has noted their intelligent ways. Ever\\nsince the first caveman began to hunt wild beasts and slay them\\nwith clubs and stones, the two warring forces have been interested\\nin each other, but for about 25,000 years I think that the wild\\nbeasts knew about as much of man's intelligence as men knew of\\ntheirs.\",\n",
       " 'I leave to those who are interested in history the task of\\nrevealing the date, or the period, when scholarly men first began\\nto pay serious attention to the animal mind.',\n",
       " 'In 1895 when Mr. George J. Romanes, of London, published his\\nexcellent work on \"Animal Intelligence,\" on one of its first pages\\nhe blithely brushed aside as of little account all the\\nobservations, articles and papers on his subject that had been\\npublished previous to that time. Now mark how swiftly history can\\nrepeat itself, and also bring retribution.',\n",
       " 'In 1910 there arose in the United States of America a group of\\nprofessional college-and-university animal psychologists who set\\nup the study of \"animal behavior.\" They did this so seriously, and\\nso determinedly, that one of the first acts of two of them\\nconsisted in joyously brushing aside as of no account whatever,\\nand quite beneath serious consideration, everything that had been\\nseen, done and said previous to the rise of their group, and the\\nlaboratory Problem Box. In view of what this group has\\naccomplished since 1910, with their \"problem boxes,\" their \"mazes\"\\nand their millions of \"trials by error,\" expressed in solid pages\\nof figures, the world of animal lovers is entitled to smile\\ntolerantly upon the cheerful assumptions of ten years ago.',\n",
       " 'But let it not at any time be assumed that we are destitute of\\nproblem boxes; for the author has two of his own! One is called\\nthe Great Outdoors, and the other is named the New York Zoological\\nPark. The first has been in use sixty years, the latter twenty-two\\nyears. Both are today in good working order, but the former is not\\nquite as good as new.',\n",
       " 'A Preachment to the Student. In studying the wild-animal mind,\\nthe boundary line between Reality and Dreamland is mighty easy to\\ncross. He who easily yields to seductive reasoning, and the call\\nof the wild imagination, soon will become a dreamer of dreams and\\na seer of visions of things that never occurred. The temptation to\\nplace upon the simple acts of animals the most complex and far-\\nfetched interpretations is a trap ever ready for the feet of the\\nunwary. It is better to see nothing than to see a lot of things\\nthat are not true.',\n",
       " 'In the study of animals, we have long insisted that _to the open\\neye and the thinking brain, truth is stranger than fiction._\\nBut Truth does not always wear her heart upon her sleeve for\\nzanies to peck at. Unfortunately there are millions of men who go\\nthrough the world looking at animals, but not seeing them.',\n",
       " 'Beware of setting up for wild animals impossible mental and moral\\nstandards. The student must not deceive himself by overestimating\\nmental values. If an estimate must be made, make it under the mark\\nof truth rather than above it. While avoiding the folly of\\nidealism, we also must shun the ways of the narrow mind, and the\\neyes that refuse to see the truth. Wild animals are not superhuman\\ndemigods of wisdom; but neither are they idiots, unable to reason\\nfrom cause to effect along the simple lines that vitally affect\\ntheir existence.',\n",
       " 'Brain-owning wild animals are not mere machines of flesh and\\nblood, set agoing by the accident of birth, and running for life\\non the narrow-gauge railway of Heredity. They are not \"Machines in\\nFur and Feathers,\" as one naturalist once tried to make the world\\nbelieve them to be. Some animals have more intelligence than some\\nmen; and some have far better morals.',\n",
       " \"What Constitutes Evidence. The best evidence regarding the ways of\\nwild animals is one's own eye-witness testimony. Not all second-\\nhand observations are entirely accurate. Many persons do not know\\nhow to observe; and at times some are deceived by their own eyes\\nor ears. It is a sad fact that both those organs are easily\\ndeceived. The student who is in doubt regarding the composition of\\nevidence will do well to spend a few days in court listening to\\nthe trial of an important and hotly contested case. In collecting\\nreal evidence, all is not gold that glitters.\",\n",
       " 'Many a mind misinterprets the thing seen, sometimes innocently,\\nand again wantonly. The nature fakir is always on the alert to see\\nwonderful phenomena in wild life, about which to write; and by\\npreference he places the most strained and marvellous\\ninterpretation upon the animal act. Beware of the man who always\\nsees marvellous things in animals, for he is a dangerous guide.\\nThere is one man who claims to have seen in his few days in the\\nwoods more wonders than all the older American naturalists and\\nsportsmen have seen added together.',\n",
       " 'Now, Nature does not assemble all her wonderful phenomena and hold\\nthem in leash to be turned loose precisely when the great Observer\\nof Wonders spends his day in the woods. Wise men always suspect\\nthe man who sees too many marvelous things.',\n",
       " 'The Relative Value of Witnesses. It is due that a word should be\\nsaid regarding \"expert testimony\" in the case of the wild animal.\\nSome dust has been raised in this field by men posing as\\nauthorities on wild animal psychology, whose observations of the\\nworld\\'s wild animals have been confined to the chipmunks,\\nsquirrels, weasels, foxes, rabbits, and birds dwelling within a\\nsmall circle surrounding some particular woodland house. In\\nanother class other men have devoted heavy scientific labors to\\nlaboratory observations on white rats, domestic rabbits, cats,\\ndogs, sparrows, turtles and newts as the handpicked exponents of\\nthe intelligence of the animals of the world!',\n",
       " 'Alas! for the human sense of Proportion!',\n",
       " 'Fancy an ethnologist studying the Eskimo, the Dog-Rib Indian, the\\nBushman, the Aino and the Papuan, and then proceeding to write\\nconclusively \"On the Intelligence of the Human Race.\"',\n",
       " 'The proper place in which to study the minds, manners and morals\\nof wild animals is in the most thickly populated haunts of the\\nmost intelligent species. The free and untrammeled animal, busily\\nworking out its own destiny unhindered by man, is the beau-ideal\\nanimal to observe and to study. Go to the plain, the wilderness,\\nthe desert and the mountain, not merely to shoot everything on\\nfoot, but to SEE _animals at home,_ and there use your eyes\\nand your field-glass. See what _normal wild animals_ do as\\n\"behavior,\" and then try to find out why they do it.',\n",
       " 'The next best place for study purposes is a spacious, sanitary and\\nwell-stocked zoological park, wherein are assembled great\\ncollections of the most interesting land vertebrates that can be\\nprocured, from all over the earth. There the student can observe\\nmany new traits of wild animal character, as they are brought to\\nthe surface by captivity. There will some individuals reveal the\\nworst traits of their species. Others will reveal marvels in\\nmentality, and teach lessons such as no man can learn from them in\\nthe open. To study temperament, there is no place like a zoo.',\n",
       " 'Even there, however, the wisest course,--as it seems to me,--is\\nnot to introduce too many appliances as aids to mental activity,\\nbut rather to see what the animal subject thinks and does _by\\nits own initiative._ In the testing of memory and the\\nperceptive faculties, training for performances is the best method\\nto pursue.',\n",
       " 'The reader has a right to know that the author of this volume has\\nenjoyed unparalleled opportunities for the observation and study\\nof highly intelligent wild animals, both in their wild haunts and\\nin a great vivarium; and these combined opportunities have covered\\na long series of years.',\n",
       " 'Before proceeding farther, it is desirable to define certain terms\\nthat frequently will be used in these pages.',\n",
       " 'THE ANIMAL BRAIN is the generator of the mind, and the clearing-\\nhouse of the senses. As a mechanism, the brain of man is the most\\nperfect, and in the descent through the mammals, birds, reptiles,\\namphibians and fishes, the brain progressively is simplified in\\nform and function.',\n",

       " 'INSANITY is a state of mental disease, resulting in disordered,\\nunbalanced and chaotic thought, destitute of reason.',\n",
       " 'REASON is the manifestation of correct observation and healthful\\nthought which recognizes both cause and effect, and leads from\\npremise to conclusion. INTELLIGENCE is created by the possession\\nof knowledge either inherited or acquired. It may be either latent\\nor active; and it is the forerunner of reason.',\n",
       " 'INSTINCT is the knowledge or impulse which animals or men derive\\nfrom their ancestors by inheritance, and which they obey, either\\nconsciously or subconsciously in working out their own\\npreservation, increase and betterment. Instinct often functions as\\na sixth sense.',\n",
       " 'EDUCATION is the acquirement of knowledge by precept or by\\nobservation; but animals as well as men may be self-taught, and\\nbecome self-educated, by the diligent exercise of the observing\\nand reasoning faculties. The adjustment of a wild animal mind to\\nconditions unknown to its ancestors is through the process of\\nself-education, and by logical reasoning from premise to\\nconclusion.',\n",
       " 'The wild animal must think, or die.',\n",
       " 'Animal intelligence varies in quantity and quality as much as\\nanimals vary in size. Idiots, maniacs and sleeping persons are the\\nonly classes of human beings who are devoid of intelligence and\\nreasoning power. Idiots and maniacs also are often devoid of the\\ncommon animal _instinct_ that ordinarily promotes self-\\npreservation from fire, water and high places. A heavily sleeping\\nperson is often so sodden in slumber that his senses of smell and\\nhearing are temporarily dead; and many a sleeping man has been\\nasphyxiated by gas or smoke, or burned to death, because his\\ndeadened senses failed to arouse him at the critical moment. (This\\ndangerous condition of mind can be cured by efforts of the will,\\nexercised prior to sleep, through a determination resolutely to\\narouse and investigate every unusual sensation that registers\\n\"danger\" on any one of the senses.) The normal individual sleeps\\nwith a subconscious and sensitive mind, from which thought and\\nreason have not been entirely eliminated.',\n",
       " 'Every act of a man or animal, vertebrate or invertebrate, is based\\nupon either _reason_ or _hereditary instinct._ It is a\\nmistake to assume that because an organism is small it\\nnecessarily has no \"mind,\" and none of the propelling impulse that\\nwe call thought. The largest whale may have less intelligence and\\nconstructive reasoning than a trap-door spider, a bee or an ant.\\nTo deny this is to deny the evidence of one\\'s senses.',\n",
       " 'A MEASURE FOR ANIMAL INTELLIGENCE. The intelligence of an animal\\nmay be estimated by taking into account, separately, its mental\\nqualities, about as follows:',\n",

       " 'All normal vertebrate animals exercise their intelligence in\\naccordance with their own rules of logic. Had they not been able\\nto do so, it is reasonable to suppose that they could never have\\ndeveloped into vertebrates, reaching even up to man himself.',\n",
       " 'According to the laws of logic, this proposition is no more open\\nto doubt or dispute than is the existence of the Grand Canyon of\\nthe Colorado. But few persons have seen the Canyon, and far fewer\\never have proven its existence by descending to its bottom; but\\nnone the less Reason admonishes all of us that the great chasm\\nexists, and is not a debatable question.',\n",
       " 'To men and women who really know the vertebrate animals by contact\\nwith some of them upon their own levels, the reasoning power of\\nthe latter is not a debatable question. The only real question is:\\nhow far does their intelligence carry them? It is with puzzled\\nsurprise that we have noted the curious diligence of the\\nprofessors of animal psychology in always writing of \"animal\\n_behavior_,\" and never of old-fashioned, common-sense\\n_animal intelligence_. Can it be possible that any one of\\nthem really refuses to concede to the wild animal the possession\\nof a mind, and a working intelligence?',\n",
       " 'Yes. Animals do reason. If any one truth has come out of all the\\ncritical or uncritical study of the animal mind that has been\\ngoing on for two centuries, it is this. Animals do reason; they\\nalways have reasoned, and as long as animals live they never will\\ncease to reason.',\n",
       " 'The higher wild animals possess and display the same fundamental\\npassions and emotions that animate the human race. This fact is\\nsubject to intelligent analysis, discussion and development, but\\nit is not by any means a \"question\" subject to debate. In the most\\nintellectual of the quadrupeds, birds and reptiles, the display of\\nfear, courage, love, hate, pleasure, displeasure, confidence,\\nsuspicion, jealousy, pity, greed and generosity are so plainly\\nevident that even children can and do recognize them. To the\\nserious and open-minded student who devotes prolonged thought to\\nthese things, they bring the wild animal very near to the \"lord of\\ncreation.\"',\n",

       " 'METHODS WITH THE ANIMAL MIND. In the study of animal minds, much\\ndepends upon the method employed. It seems to me that the problem-\\nbox method of the investigators of \"animal behavior\" leaves much\\nto be desired. Certainly it is not calculated to develop the\\nmental status of animals along lines of natural mental\\nprogression. To place a wild creature in a great artificial\\ncontrivance, fitted with doors, cords, levers, passages and what\\nnot, is enough to daze or frighten any timid animal out of its\\nnormal state of mind and nerves. To put a wild sapajou monkey,--\\nweak, timid and afraid,--in a strange and formidable prison box\\nfilled with strange machinery, and call upon it to learn or to\\ninvent strange mechanical processes, is like bringing a boy of ten\\nyears up to a four-cylinder duplex Hoe printing-and-folding press,\\nand saying to him: \"Now, go ahead and find out how to run this\\nmachine, and print both sides of a signature upon it.\"',\n",
       " 'The average boy would shrink from the mechanical monster, and have\\nno stomach whatever for \"trial by error.\"',\n",
       " 'I think that the principle of determining the mind of a wild\\nanimal _along the lines of the professor_ is not the best\\nway. It should be developed _along the natural lines of the\\nwild-animal mind._ It should be stimulated to do what it feels\\nmost inclined to do, and educated to achieve real mental progress.',\n",
       " 'I think that the ideal way to study the minds of apes, baboons and\\nmonkeys would be to choose a good location in a tropical or sub-\\ntropical climate that is neither too wet nor too dry, enclose an\\narea of five acres with an unclimbable fence, and divide it into\\nas many corrals as there are species to be experimented upon. Each\\ncorral would need a shelter house and indoor playroom. The stage\\nproperties should be varied and abundant, and designed to\\nstimulate curiosity as well as activity.',\n",
       " 'Somewhere in the program I would try to teach orang-utans and\\nchimpanzees the properties of fire, and how to make and tend\\nfires. I would try to teach them the seed-planting idea, and the\\nmeaning of seedtime and harvest. I would teach sanitation and\\ncleanliness of habit,--a thing much more easily done than most\\npersons suppose.

       " 'WILD ANIMAL TEMPERAMENT AND INDIVIDUALITY',\n",
       " '\\nIn man and in vertebrate animals generally, temperament is the\\nfoundation of intelligence and progress. Fifty years ago Fowler\\nand Wells, the founders of the science of phrenology and\\nphysiognomy, very wisely differentiated and defined four\\n\"temperaments\" of mankind. The six types now recognized by me are\\nthe _morose, lymphatic, sanguine, nervous, hysterical_ and\\n_combative_; and their names adequately describe them.',\n",
       " 'This classification applies to the higher wild animals, quite as\\ntruly as to men. By the manager of wild animals in captivity,\\nwild-animal temperament universally is recognized and treated as a\\nfactor of great practical importance. Mistakes in judging the\\ntemper of dangerous animals easily lead to tragedies and sudden\\ndeath.',\n",
       " 'Fundamentally the temperament of a man or an animal is an\\ninheritance from ancestors near or remote. In the human species a\\nmorose or hysterical temperament may possibly be corrected or\\nimproved, by education and effort. With animals this is rarely\\npossible. The morose gorilla gives way to cheerfulness only when\\nit is placed in ideally pleasant and stimulating social\\nconditions. This, however, very seldom is possible. The nervous\\ndeer, bear or monkey is usually nervous to the end of its days.',\n",
       " 'The morose and hysterical temperaments operate against mental\\ndevelopment, progress and happiness. In the human species among\\nindividuals of equal mental calibre, the sanguine individual is\\ndue to rise higher and go farther than his nervous or lymphatic\\nrivals. A characteristic temperament may embrace the majority of\\na whole species, or be limited to a few individuals. Many species\\nare permanently characterized by the temperament common to the\\nmajority of their individual members. Thus, among the great apes\\nthe gorilla species is either morose or lymphatic; and it is\\nmanifested by persistent inactivity and sullenness. This leads to\\nloss of appetite, indigestion, inactivity and early death. Major\\nPenny\\'s \"John Gorilla\" was a notable exception, as will appear in\\nChapter IX.',\n",
       " 'The orang-utan is sanguine, optimistic and cheerful, a good\\nboarder, affectionate toward his keepers, and friendly toward\\nstrangers. He eats well, enjoys life, lives long, and is well\\nliked by everybody.',\n",
       " 'Except when quite young, the chimpanzee is either nervous or\\nhysterical. After six years of age it is irritable and difficult\\nto manage. After seven years of age (puberty) it is rough,\\ndomineering and dangerous. The male is given to shouting, yelling,\\nshrieking and roaring, and when quite angry rages like a demon. I\\nknow of no wild animal that is more dangerous per pound than a\\nmale chimpanzee over eight years of age. When young they do\\nwonders in trained performances, but when they reach maturity,\\ngrow big of arm and shoulder, and masterfully strong, they quickly\\nbecome conscious of their strength. It is then that performing\\nchimpanzees become unruly, fly into sudden fits of temper, their\\nback hair bristles up, they stamp violently, and sometimes leap\\ninto a terrorized orchestra. Next in order, they are retired\\nwilly-nilly from the stage, and are offered for sale to zoological\\nparks and gardens having facilities for confinement and control.',\n",

The awful canine teeth of an old\\nmale baboon are quite as dangerous as those of any leopard, and\\neven the leopard's onslaught is less to be feared than the wild\\nrage of an adult baboon.

The proneness of captive deer to maim and\\nto kill themselves and each other calls for the utmost vigilance,\\nand for heroic endurance on the part of the deer keeper.',\n",

       " 'The barasingha deer is hysterical and unaccountable.',\n",

As an example of\\ntemperament in small carnivores, we will cite the coati mundi of\\nSouth America. It is one of the most nervous and restless animals\\nwe know. An individual of sanguine temperament rarely is seen. Out\\nof about forty specimens with which we have been well acquainted,\\nI do not recall one that was as quiet and phlegmatic as the\\nraccoon, the nearest relative of _Nasua_. With a disposition\\nso restless and enterprising, and with such vigor of body and\\nmind, I count it strange that the genus _Nasua_ has not\\nspread all over our south-eastern states, where it is surely\\nfitted to exist in a state of nature even more successfully than\\nthe raccoon or opossum.',\n",
       " 'The temper of the coati mundi is essentially quarrelsome and\\naggressive. While young, they are reasonably peaceful, but when\\nthey reach adult age, they become aggressive, and quarrels are\\nfrequent. Separations then are very necessary, and it is rare\\nindeed that more than two adult individuals can be caged together.\\nEven when two only are kept together, quarrels and shrill\\nsquealings are frequent. But they seldom hurt each other. The\\ncoati is not a treacherous animal, it is not given to lying in\\nwait to make a covert attack from ambush, and being almost\\nconstantly on the move, it is a good show animal.',\n",

In a wild\\nstate amongst its own kind, or in captivity,--no matter how\\nconsiderately treated,--it is a quarrelsome and at times\\nintractable animal. \"A pair of wild guanacos can often be seen or\\nheard engaged in desperate combat, biting and tearing, and rolling\\nover one another on the ground, uttering their gurgling, bubbling\\ncries of rage. Of a pair so engaged, I shot one whose tail had\\nthen been bitten off in the encounter.

       " 'MENTAL TRAITS AND TEMPER OF THE ATLANTIC WALRUS',\n",
       " 'Mr. Langdon Gibson, of Schenectady, kindly wrote out for me the\\nfollowing highly interesting observations on a remarkable arctic\\nanimal with which we are but slightly acquainted:',\n",
       " '\"In the summer of 1891, as a member of the first Peary Expedition\\nI had an opportunity of observing some of the traits of the\\nAtlantic walrus. I found him to be a real animal, of huge size,\\nwith an extremely disagreeable temper and most belligerently\\ninclined. We hunted them in open whale-boats under the shadows of\\nGreenland\\'s mountain-bound coast, in the Whale Sound region, Lat.\\n77 degrees North.',\n",
       " '\"We hunted among animals never before molested, except by the\\nEskimo who (so far as I was able to ascertain) hunt them only\\nduring the winter season on the sea ice. We found animals whose\\ncourage and belief in themselves and their prowess had hitherto\\nbeen unshaken by contact with the white man and his ingenious\\ndevices of slaughter.',\n",
       " '\"The walrus has a steady nerve and a thoroughly convincing roar.\\nThey have fought their kind and the elements for centuries and\\ncenturies, and know no fear. This, then, was the animal we sought\\nin order to secure food for our dog teams. I can conceive of no\\nform of big game hunting so conducive to great mental excitement\\nand physical activity as walrus hunting from an open whale-boat.\\nAt the completion of such a hunt I have seen Eskimo so excited and\\nworked up that they were taken violently sick with vomiting and\\nheadache.',\n",
       " '\"The walrus is a gregarious animal, confederating in herds\\nnumbering from ten to fifty, and in some instances no doubt larger\\nnumbers may be found together. On calm days they rest in\\nunmolested peace on pans of broken ice which drift up and down the\\nwaters of Whale Sound. It is unfortunate that no soundings were\\ntaken in the region where the walrus were found, as a knowledge of\\nthe depth of water would have furnished some information as to the\\ndistances to which the animal will dive in search of food.',\n",
       " '\"The stomachs of all half- and full-grown walrus taken in Whale\\nSound were without exception well filled with freshly opened\\nclams, with very few fragments of shells in evidence; the removal\\nof the clam from the shell being as neatly accomplished as though\\ndone by an expert oysterman.',\n",
       " '\"In most cases these segregated herds of walrus were in charge of\\na large bull who generally occupied a central position in the mass\\nof animals. Upon approaching such a herd for the first time, and\\nwhen within about 200 feet, a large bull would lift his head,\\nsniff audibly in our direction and give a loud grunt which\\napparently struck a responsive chord in the other sleeping\\nanimals. They would grunt in unison, in more subdued tones, after\\nwhich the old walrus would drop his head to resume his interrupted\\nnap. Their contempt for us was somewhat disconcerting.',\n",
       " '\"At the first crack of a rifle, however, the animals immediately\\naroused, and then during the fusillade which followed there\\noccurred what might be called an orderly scramble for the water.\\nIn the first place the young ones were hustled to the edge of the\\nice-pan, and there, apparently under the protection of the\\nmother\\'s flipper, pushed into the water, immediately followed by\\nthe mother. The young bulls followed, and I recall no exceptions\\nwhere the last animal into the water was not the big bull, who\\nbefore diving would give our boat a wicked look and a roar of\\nrage.',\n",
       " '\"The animals would immediately dive, and then we first became\\naware of a remarkable phenomenon. We found that when excited they\\nwould continue their roaring under water, and these strange sounds\\ncoming to us from below added considerably to the excitement of\\nthe chase. Although the cows and young animals would generally\\nswim to places of safety, the other full grown animals would hover\\nbeneath our boat and from time to time come to the surface and\\ncharge. These charges were in all cases repulsed by the discharge\\nof our rifles in the faces of the animals. The balls, however,\\nfrom our .45 calibre carbines would flatten out under the skin on\\nthe massive bony structure of the animal\\'s skull, and cause only a\\nsort of rage and a sneeze, but it however had the effect of making\\nthem dive again. It is my belief that when enraged the walrus if\\nnot resisted would attack and attempt to destroy a boat. Icquah,\\none of our native hunters, showed me in the deck of his kyak two\\nmended punctures which he told me were made by the tusks of a\\nwalrus that had made an _unprovoked_ attack upon him.',\n",
       " '\"On more than one occasion I have seen two strong uninjured\\nanimals come to the assistance of a wounded companion, and swim\\naway with it to a position of safety, _the injured animal being\\nsupported on both sides_, giving the appearance of three\\nanimals swimming abreast. The first time I witnessed this I did\\nnot comprehend its real meaning, but on another occasion in\\nMcCormick Bay I saw a wounded animal leaving a trail of blood and\\noil, supported on either side by two uninjured ones. They were\\nmaking a hasty retreat and would occasionally dive together, but\\nwould quickly return to the surface.',\n",
       " '\"We found the most effective exposed spot to place a bullet was at\\nthe base of the animal\\'s skull. A walrus instantly killed this way\\ngenerally sinks, leaving a trail of blood and oil to mark the\\nplace of his descent. When hunting these animals it is well to\\nhave an Eskimo along with harpoon and line in readiness to make\\nfast; otherwise one is apt to lose his quarry.',\n",
       " '\"In the early winter we usually found the walrus in smaller groups\\nup in the bays. This was after the ice had begun to make, and in\\ncoming to the surface to breathe the animals found it necessary\\nto butt their noses against the ice to break it. I have seen this\\ndone in ice at least four inches in thickness. In some instances\\nI have seen a fractured star in the ice, a record of an unsuccessful\\nattempt to make a breathing hole.\" Around these breathing holes\\nwe frequently found fragments of clam-shells, sections of\\ncrinoids and sea-anemones. It is evident that after raking the\\nbottom with his tusks and filling his mouth with food, the walrus\\nseparates the food he desires to retain and rejects on his way up\\nand at the surface such articles as he has picked up in haste and\\ndoes not want.',\n",
       " '\"From the fact that the walrus is easily approached it is a simple\\nmatter to kill him with the modern high power rule. It is\\ntherefore to be hoped that future expeditions into the arctic seas\\nwill kill sparingly of these tremendous brutes which from point of\\nsize stand in the foremost rank among mammals.\"',\n",
       " 'The Elephant, Rhinoceros and Hippopotamus. _Individual\\nElephants_ vary in temperament far more than do rhinoceroses\\nor hippopotami, and the variations are wide. In a wild state,\\nelephants are quiet and undemonstrative, almost to the point of\\ndullness. They do not domineer, or hector, or quarrel, save when a\\nrogue develops in the ranks, and sets out to make things\\ninteresting by the commission of lawless acts. A professional\\nrogue is about everything that an orthodox elephant should not\\nbe, and he soon makes of himself so great a nuisance that he is\\ndriven out of the herd.',\n",
       " 'The temperament of the standardized and normal elephant is\\ndistinctly sanguine, _but a nervous or hysterical individual is\\neasily developed by bad conditions or abuse_. Adult male\\nelephants are subject to various degrees of what we may as well\\ncall sexual insanity, which is dangerous in direct proportion to\\nits intensity. This causes many a \"bad\" show elephant to be\\npresented to a zoological garden, where the dangers of this mental\\ncondition can at least be reduced to their lowest terms. Our\\nIndian elephant who was known as Gunda was afflicted with sexual\\ninsanity, and he gradually grew worse, and increasingly dangerous\\nto his keepers, until finally it was necessary to end his troubles\\npainlessly with a bullet through his brain.',\n",
       " '_The Rhinoceros_ is a sanguine animal, of rather dull vision\\nand slow understanding. In captivity it gives little trouble, and\\nlives long. Adults individually often become pettish, or peevish,\\nand threaten to prod their keepers without cause, but I have never\\nknown a keeper to take those lapses seriously. The average rhino\\nis by no means a dull or a stupid animal, and they have quite\\nenough life to make themselves interesting to visitors. In British\\nEast Africa a black rhinoceros often trots briskly toward a\\ncaravan, and seems to be charging, when in reality it is only\\ndesiring a \"close-up\" to satisfy its legitimate curiosity.',\n",
       " '_Every Hippopotamus_, either Nile or pygmy, is an animal of\\nserene mind and steady habits. Their appetites work with clock-\\nlike regularity, and require no winding. I can not recall that any\\none of our five hippos was ever sick for a day, or missed a meal.\\nWhen the idiosyncrasies of Gunda, our bad elephant, were at their\\nworst, the contemplation of Peter the Great ponderously and\\nserenely chewing his hay was a rest to tired nerves. Keeper Thuman\\ntreats the four pygmy hippos like so many pet pigs,--save the\\nsolitary adult male, who sets himself up to be peevish. The\\nbreeding female is a wise and good mother, with much more maternal\\ninstinct than our chimpanzee \"Suzette.\"',\n",

       " '_Giraffe_ individuals vary exceedingly,--beyond all other\\nhoofed animals. Each one has its own headful of notions, and\\nrarely will two be found quite alike in temperament and views of\\nlife. Some are sanguine and sensible, others are nervous,\\ncrotchety, and full of senseless fears. Those who are responsible\\nfor them in captivity are constantly harassed by fears that they\\nwill stampede in their stalls or yards, and break their own necks\\nand legs in most unexpected ways.

       " '\\nLanguage is the means by which men and animals express their\\nthoughts. Of language there are four kinds: vocal, pictured,\\nwritten and sign language.',\n",
       " \"Any vocal sound uttered for the purpose of conveying thought, or\\ninfluencing thought or action, is to be classed as vocal language.\\nAmong the mammals below man, _speech_ is totally absent; but\\nparrots, macaws, cockatoos and crows have been taught to imitate\\nthe sound of man's words, or certain simple kinds of music.\",\n",
       " 'The primitive races of mankind first employed the sign language,\\nand spoken words. After that comes picture language, and lastly\\nthe language of written words. Among the Indians and frontiersmen\\nof the western United States and Canada, the sign language has\\nreached what in all probability is its highest development, and\\nits vocabulary is really wonderful.',\n",
       " 'The higher wild animals express their thoughts and feelings\\nusually by sign language, and rarely by vocal sounds. Their power\\nof expression varies species by species, or tribe by tribe, quite\\nas it does among the races and tribes of men. It is our belief\\nthat there are today several living races of men whose\\nvocabularies are limited to about 300 words.',\n",
       " 'Very many species of animals appear to be voiceless; but it is\\nhazardous to attempt to specify the species. Sometimes under\\nstress of new emergencies, or great pain, animals that have been\\nconsidered voiceless suddenly give tongue. That hundreds of\\nspecies of mammals and birds use their voices in promoting\\nmovements for their safety, there is no room to doubt. The only\\nquestion is of the methods and the extent of voice used. Birds and\\nmen give expression to their pleasure or joy by singing.',\n",
       " 'In the jungle and the heavily wooded wilderness, one hears really\\nlittle of vocal wild-animal language. Through countless\\ngenerations the noisiest animals have been the first ones to be\\nsought out and killed by their enemies, and only the more silent\\nspecies have survived. All the higher animals, as we call the\\nhigher vertebrates, have the ability to exchange thoughts and\\nconvey ideas; and that is language.',\n",
       " \"At the threshold of this subject we are met by two interesting\\nfacts. Excepting the song-birds, the wild creatures of today have\\nlearned through instinct and accumulated experience that silence\\npromotes peace and long life. The bull moose who bawls through a\\nmile of forest, and the bull elk who bugles not wisely but too\\nwell, soon find their heads hanging in some sportsman's dining-\\nroom, while the silent Virginia deer, like the brook, goes on\\nforever.\",\n",
       " 'Association with man through countless generations has taught\\ndomestic animals not only the fact of their safety when giving\\nvoice, but also that very often there is great virtue in a\\nvigorous outcry. With an insistent staccato neigh, the hungry\\nhorse jars the dull brain of its laggard master, and prompts him\\nto \"feed and water the stock.\" But how different is the cry of a\\nlost horse, which calls for rescue. It cannot be imitated in\\nprinted words; but every plainsman knows the shrill and prolonged\\ntrumpet-call of distress that can be heard a mile or more,\\nunderstandingly.',\n",

While feeding, or quietly\\nenjoying the morning sun, the gray gibbon (_Hylobates\\nconcolor_) emits in leisurely succession a low staccato,\\nwhistle-like cry, like \"Hoot! Hoot! Hoot!\" which one can easily\\ncounterfeit by whistling. This is varied by another whistle cry of\\nthree notes, thus: \"Who-ee-hoo! Who-ee-hoo!\" also to be duplicated\\nby whistling. In hunting for specimens of that gibbon, for\\nAmerican museums, I could rarely locate a troop save by the tree-\\ntop talk of its members.',\n",

Moreover, the inside portion\\nof the door of some species is so constructed that it may be\\n\"latched,\" there being two holes near the edge, precisely placed\\nwhere the curved fangs may be inserted and the door held firmly\\nclosed.

In the\\nexcavation of the tube and retention of the walls, the spider\\nappears to employ a glairy substance, which thoroughly saturates\\nthe soil and renders the interior of the tube of almost cement-\\nlike hardness. It is then plastered with a thick jet of silk from\\nthe spinning glands. This interior finishing process appears to\\nbe quite rapid, a burrow being readily lined within a couple of\\nhours.',\n",

Judging from observations on a\\nnumber of specimens, the work is done from the outside, the spider\\nfirst spinning a net-like covering over the mouth of the tube.\\nThis is thickened by weaving the body over the net, each motion\\nleaving a smoky trail of silk. Earth is then shoveled into the\\ncovering, the spider carefully pushing the particles toward the\\ncentre, which soon sags, and assumes the proper curvature, and\\nautomatically moulds against the bevelled walls of the tube.',\n",
       " '\"The shoveling process must be nicely regulated to produce the\\nproper bevel and thickness of the door. Then the cementing\\nprocess is applied to the top, rendering the door a solid unit.\\nFrom the actions of these spiders,--which often calmly rest an\\nhour without a move,--it appears that the edges of the door are\\nnow subjected, by the stout and sharp fangs, to a cutting process\\nlike that of a can opener, leaving a portion of the marginal silk\\nto act as a hinge. This hinge afterward receives some finishing\\ntouches, and the top of the door is either pebbled or finished\\nwith a few fragments of dead vegetation, cemented on, in order to\\nexactly match the surrounding soil.\"',\n",

The pavement was hot, but there with its\\nbare and tender feet on the hot concrete, the sad-eyed little waif\\npainfully moved about, peering far up into the faces of passers-by\\nfor sympathy, but all the time furtively and shrinkingly watching\\nits tormentor. Every now and then the hairy old tramp would jerk\\nthe monkey\\'s cord, each time giving the frail creature a violent\\nbodily wrench from head to foot.

Even today the mechanical\\nskill involved in its construction is beyond my comprehension. My\\ndull brain can not figure out the processes by which the bird\\nbegins to weave its hanging purse at the tip end of the most\\nunstable of all earthly building sites,--a down-hanging elm-tree\\nbranch that is swayed to and fro by every passing breeze.

I doubt it. The materials consist of long strips of\\nthe thin inner bark of trees, short strings, and tiny grass stems\\nthat are long, pliable and tough.

Out of the multitude\\nof exhibits available I will limit myself to three, widely\\nseparated. In the first place, the habitations of the savage and\\nbarbaric tribes are usually the direct result of their own mental\\nand moral deficiencies. The Eskimo is an exception, because his\\nhome and its location are dictated by the hard and fierce\\ncircumstances which dictate to him what he must do. Often he is\\ncompelled to move as his food supply moves. The Cliff-Dweller\\nIndian of the arid regions of the Southwest was forced to cliff-\\ndwell, in order to stave off extermination by his enemies. Under\\nthat spur he became a wonderful architect and engineer.',\n",

North of it lie\\nplains less rigorous, and by degrees less sterile, and finally\\nthere are lands quite habitable by cattle-and-crop-growing men.',\n",
       " 'But those three tribes elect to stick to the worst spot in South\\nAmerica. The most primitive is the tribe of \"canoe Indians\" of\\nTierra del Fuego, which probably represents the lowest rung of the\\nhuman ladder. Beside them the cave men of 30,000 years ago were\\nkings and princes.

It was merely a\\nplatform of small poles, placed like a glorified bird's nest in\\nthe spreading forks of a many-branched tree, about twenty feet\\nfrom the ground.

Obviously, it is more\\ninteresting to fathom the mind of a creature in an absolute state\\nof nature than of one whose ancestors have been bred and reared in\\nthe trammels of domestication and for many successive generations\\nhave bowed to the will of man. The natural fury of the Atlantic\\nwalrus, when attacked, is much more interesting as a psychologic\\nstudy than is the inbred rage of the bull-dog; and the remarkable\\ndefensive tactics of the musk-ox far surpass in interest the\\nvagaries of range cattle.',\n",

The great apes mentioned can give visible expression to a\\nwide range of thoughts and emotions,',\n",
       " 'The voice of the adult orang-utan is almost absent, and only\\nsufficient to display on rare occasions. What little there is of\\nit, in animals over six years of age, is very deep and guttural,\\nand may best be described as a deep-bass roar.

The superior feet of\\nthe chimpanzee in bipedal work is for that species a great\\nadvantage, and the longer toes of the orang are a handicap.\\nAlthough the orang's sanguine temperament is far more comforting\\nto a trainer than the harum-scarum nervous vivacity of the\\nchimpanzee, the value of the former is overbalanced, on the stage,\\nby the superior acting of the chimp. For these reasons the\\ntrainers generally choose the chimp for stage education.\",\n",

Once when I attempted to\\ntake from our large black-faced chimpanzee, called Soko, a small\\nlump of rubber which I feared she might swallow, my efforts were\\nkindly but firmly thwarted. At last, when I diverted her by small\\nofferings of chocolate, and at the right moment sought by a\\nstrategic movement to snatch the rubber from her, the palpable\\nunfairness of the attempt caused the animal instantly to fly into\\na towering passion, and seek to wreak vengeance upon me. Her lips\\ndrew far back in a savage snarl, and she denounced my perfidy by\\npiercing cries of rage and indignation. She also did her utmost to\\nseize and drag me forcibly within reach of her teeth, for the\\npunishment which she felt that I deserved.',\n",
       " 'A large male orang-utan named Dohong, under a similar test,\\nrevealed a very different mental attitude.

At once the animal came down\\nto me, to secure another trophy, and before he realized his\\nposition I successfully snatched the charm from him, and restored\\nit unharmed to its owner.

The orang-utans of the New York\\nZoological Park certainly have been as cheerful in disposition, as\\nfond of exercise and as fertile in droll performances as our\\nchimpanzees. Even though the mind of the chimpanzee does act more\\nquickly than that of its rival, and even though its movements are\\nusually more rapid and more precise, the mind of the orang carries\\nthat animal precisely as far.

Some chimpanzees are too nervous to be taught, some\\nare too obstinate, and others are too impatient of restraint. Some\\norang-utans are hopelessly indifferent to the business in hand,\\nand refuse to become interested in it.

       " 'When three years old he discovered his own strength, and at first\\nhe used it good-naturedly to hector his cage-mate, a female\\nchimpanzee smaller than himself. That, however, was of trifling\\ninterest. The day on which he made the discovery that he could\\nbreak the wooden one and one-half inch horizontal bars that were\\nheld out from his cage walls on cast iron brackets, was for him a\\ngreat day. Before his discovery was noted by the keepers he had\\njoyfully destroyed two bars, and with a broken piece used as a\\nlever was attacking a third. These bars were promptly replaced by\\nlarger bars, of harder wood, but screwed to the same cast-iron\\nbrackets that had carried the first series.',\n",
       " 'For a time, the heavier bars endured; but in an evil moment the\\nape swung his trapeze bar, of two-inch oak, far over to one side\\nof his cage, and applied the bar as a lever, inside of a\\nhorizontal bar and from above. The new force was too much for the\\ncast-iron brackets, and one by one they gave way. Some were broken\\noff, and others were torn from the wall by the breaking of the\\nscrews that held them. Knowing that all those brackets\\nmust be changed immediately, Dohong was left to destroy them;\\nwhich he did, promptly and joyfully. We then made heavy\\nbrackets of flat wrought iron bars, 1/2 by 21/2 inches, unbreakable\\neven with a lever. These were screwed on with screws\\nso large and heavy that our carpenters knew they were quite\\nsecure.',\n",
       " '[Illustration caption: THE LEVER THAT OUR ORANG-UTAN INVENTED, AND\\nTHE WAY HE APPLIED IT By W. A. Camadeo, in the \"Scientific\\nAmerican,\" 1907]',\n",
       " \"In due time, Dohong tested his lever upon the bars with their new\\nbrackets, and at first they held securely. Then he engaged Polly,\\nhis chimpanzee companion, to assist him to the limit of her\\nstrength. While Dohong pulled on the lever, Polly braced her\\nabsurd little back against the wall, and pushed upon it, with all\\nher strength. At first nothing gave way. The combined strength\\nexerted by the three brackets was not to be overcome by prying at\\nthe horizontal bar itself. It was then that Dohong's inventive\\ngenius rose to its climax. He decided to attack the brackets\\nsingly, and conquer them one by one. On examining the situation\\nvery critically, he found that each bracket consisted of a right-\\nangled triangle of wrought iron, with its perpendicular side\\nagainst the wall, its base uppermost, and its hypotenuse out in\\nthe air. Through the open centre of the triangle he introduced the\\nend of his trapeze bar, chain and all, as far as it would go, then\\ngave a mighty heave. The end of his lever was against the wall,\\nand the power was applied in such a manner that few machine screws\\ncould stand so great a strain. One by one, the screws were torn\\nout of the wood, and finally each bracket worked upon was torn\\noff.\",\n",
       " \"But there was one exception. The screws of one bracket were so\\nfirmly set in a particularly hard strip of the upright tongued-\\nand-grooved yellow pine flooring that formed the wall, the board\\nitself was finally torn out, full length! The board was four\\ninches wide, seven-eighths of an inch thick, and seven feet long.\\nOriginally it was so firmly nailed that no one believed that it\\ncould be torn from its place. [Footnote: In the Winter of 1921\\nabout a dozen newspapers in the United States published a\\nsensational syndicated article, occupying an entire page, in which\\nall of Dohong's lever discovery and cage-wrecking performances\\nwere reported as of recent occurrence, and credited to a stupid\\nand uninteresting young orang called Gabong, now in the Zoological\\nPark, that has not even the merit of sufficient intelligence to\\nmaintain a proper state of bodily uprightness, let alone the\\ninvention of mechanical principles.]\",\n",
       " 'Without delay, Dohong started in with his lever to pry off the\\nremaining boards of the wall, but this movement was promptly\\nchecked. Our next task consisted in making long bolts by which the\\nbrackets of the horizontal bars were bolted entirely through the\\npartition walls and held so powerfully on the other side that even\\nthe lever could not wreck them.',\n",
       " 'As soon as the brackets were made secure, Dohong turned his\\nattention to the two large sleeping boxes which were built very\\nsolidly on the balcony of his cage. Both of those structures he\\ntore completely to pieces,--always working with the utmost good\\nnature and cheerfulness. Realizing that they could not exist in\\nthe cage with him, we gave him a permit to tear them out--and save\\nthe time of the carpenters.',\n",
       " \"Dohong's use of his lever was seen by hundreds of visitors, and\\none frequent visitor to the Park, Mr. L. A. Camacho, an engineer,\\nwas so much impressed that he published in the _Scientific\\nAmerican_ an illustrated account of what he saw.\",\n",
       " 'For a long period, Dohong had been more or less annoyed by the\\nfact that he could not get his head out between the front bars of\\nhis cage, and look around the partition into the home of his next-\\ndoor neighbor. Very soon after he discovered the use of the lever,\\nhe swung his trapeze bar out to the upper corner of his cage,\\nthrust the end of it out between the first bar and the steel\\ncolumn of the partition, and very deftly bent two of the iron bars\\noutward far enough so that he could easily thrust his head outside\\nand have his coveted look.',\n",
       " 'One of our later and largest orangs made a specialty of twisting\\nthe straw of his bedding into a rope six or seven feet long, then\\nthrowing it over his trapeze bar and swinging by it, forward and\\nback.',\n",

Really, when a well trained \"chimp\" is dressed\\nfrom head to foot like a man, and is seen going with quickness,\\nprecision and spirit through a performance half an hour in length,\\nwe go away from it with an uncomfortable feeling that speech is\\nall that he lacks of being a citizen.',\n",

Then came I\\nknow not how many more, including the giant Casey and Mr. Garner's\\nSusie; and finally in 1918 our own Suzette. The theatre-going\\npublic has been well supplied with trained chimpanzees, and the\\nmental capacity of that species is now more widely known and\\nappreciated than that of any other wild animal except the Indian\\nelephant.\",\n",
       " 'There are several reasons why chimpanzees predominate on the\\nstage, and why so few performing orang-utans have been seen. They\\nare as follows:',\n",

If he\\nsurvives to see his sixth or seventh year, it is then that he\\nbecomes so strong and so full of ego that he becomes dangerous and\\nrequires to be retired.',\n",

I would\\nrather descend from a clean, capable and bright-minded genus of\\napes than from any unclean, ignorant and repulsive race of the\\ngenus _Homo._ In comparing the chimpanzees of Fernan Vaz\\nwith the Canoe Indians of the Strait of Magellan and other human\\ntribes we could name, I think the former have decidedly the best\\nof it. There are millions of members of the human race who are\\nmore loathsome and repulsive than wild apes.',\n",
       " 'The face of the chimpanzee is highly mobile, and the mouth, lips,\\neyes and voice express the various emotions of the individual\\nwith a degree of clearness and precision second only to the facial\\nexpression of man himself. In fact, the face of an intelligent\\nchimpanzee or orang-utan is a fairly constant index of the state\\nof mind of the individual. In their turn, those enormously\\nexpansive lips and keen brown eyes express contentment, doubt,\\nfear and terror; affection, disapproval, jealousy, anger, rage;\\nhunger and satiety; lonesomeness and illness.',\n",

While\\nit is not possible to offer a description of each which will\\ncertainly be recognizable to the reader, the two extremes will at\\nleast be appreciated. When coaxing for food, or attention, the\\nlips are thrust far out beyond the teeth, and formed into a funnel\\nwith the small end outermost. When the chimpanzee flies into a\\nrage at some real or fancied offense, the snarling lips are drawn\\nback, and far up and down, until the teeth and gums are fully\\nexposed in a ghastly threat of attack. At the same time, the voice\\ngives forth shrill shrieks of rage, correctly represented by the\\nsyllable \"Ee-ee-ee!\", prolonged, and repeated with great force,\\nthree or four times. On such occasions as the latter, the\\noffending party must look out for himself, or he may be roughly\\nhandled.',\n",

It is heard when the animal says, coaxingly, \"Who\\'-oe!\\nWho\\'-oe!\" A dozen times a day, our large specimens indulge in\\nspells of loud yelling, purely for their own amusement. Their\\nstrident cry sounds like \"Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! _Wah\\'_-hoo!\\n_Wah\\'_-hoo!

If any commands or signs were given, the\\naudience was not aware of it. Later on I learned that sometimes\\nPeter did not perform with such spirit, and required some urging\\nto be prompt.

It was a genuine love match, and strictly\\nmonogamous at that; for while big Fanny Chimp in the cage next\\ndoor to Boma loved Boma and openly courted him, he was\\noutrageously indifferent to her, and even scorned her. After\\nseven months of gestation, a very good baby was born to Suzette,\\nquite naturally and successfully. Boma's shouts of excitement and\\ndelight carried half a mile throughout the Park. Everything looked\\nmost auspicious for the rearing of a wonderful cage-bred and\\ncage-born chimpanzee, the second one ever born in captivity.\\nInstead of carrying her infant astride her hip, as do orang\\nmothers, and the coolie women of India, Suzette astonished us\\nbeyond measure by tucking it _into her groin,_ between her\\nthigh and her abdomen, head outward. It was a fine place,--warm\\nand soft,--but not good when overdone! When Suzette walked, as she\\nfreely did, she held up the leg responsible for the baby, to hold\\nit securely in place, and walked upon the other foot and her two\\nhands. About all this there was one very bad thing. The baby was\\nperfectly helpless! As long as the mother chose to keep it in her\\ngroin prison, it could not get free.\",\n",
       " \"Suzette was completely isolated, kept absolutely quiet, and every\\nchance was given her to go on with the functions of motherhood.\\nHer breasts contained plenty of milk, and the flow was due to\\nstart on the second day after the infant's arrival.\",\n",
       " 'Day and night the baby was jealously confined in that massive and\\npowerful groin,--and _under too much pressure!_ When the baby\\ncried, and kicked, and struggled to get free, Suzette would\\nnervously rearrange her straw bed, carefully pick from the tiny\\nfingers every straw that they had clutched, and settle down again.\\nIf the struggle was soon renewed, Suzette would change the infant\\nover to the other groin, and close upon it as before.',\n",
       " 'Sleeping or waking, walking, sitting or lying down, she held it\\nthere. If we attempted to touch the infant, the mother instantly\\nbecame savage and dangerous. Not one human finger was permitted to\\ntouch it. For hours, and for days, we anxiously watched for\\nnursing to begin; but in vain. At last we became almost frantic\\nfrom the spectacle of the infant being slowly starved to death\\nbecause the mother did not realize that it needed her milk, and\\nthat she alone could promote nursing. _Her mother instinct\\nutterly failed to supply the link that alone could connect infancy\\nto motherhood, and furnish life._',\n",
       " \"Of course this failure was due to poor Suzette's artificial life,\\nand unnatural surroundings. Had she been all alone, in the depths\\nof a tropical forest, Nature would have proceeded along her usual\\nlines. But in our Primate House, Suzette felt that her infant was\\nsurrounded by a host of strange enemies, from whom it must be\\nstrongly and persistently _guarded and defended._ That was\\nthe idea that completely dominated her mind, ruled out all human\\nhelp, and blocked the main process of nature.\",\n",
       " 'During the eight days that the infant lived, it was able to reach\\nher breast and nurse only once, for about one minute; and then\\nback it went to its prison, where it died from sheer lack of\\nnourishment.',\n",
       " 'In 1920, that same history was repeated, except that on this\\noccasion our Veterinary Surgeon, Dr. W. Reid Blair, worked (on the\\nfifth day) for seven hours without intermission to stupefy Suzette\\nwith chloroform, or other opiates, sufficiently to make it\\npossible to remove the baby without a fight with the mother and\\nits certain death. Owing to her savage temper all the work had to\\nbe done between iron bars, to keep from losing hands or arms, and\\nthe handicap on the human hand was too great. Even when Suzette\\nhad received chloroform for an hour and twenty minutes, and was\\nregarded as _half dead,_ at the first touch of a human finger\\nupon her thigh she instantly aroused and sprang up, raging and\\nready for battle.',\n",

The male individual that lived several years in the\\nBreslau Zoological Garden and attained the age of seven years was\\na striking exception.',\n",

This we found he had done in the store where\\nhe lived before coming to us. He always began to cry directly he\\nsaw the assistants putting things away for the night. We found\\nthat this loneliness at night was trying on his health and\\nappetite. As soon as possible my nephew had his bed made up every\\nnight in the room adjoining the cage, with the result that John\\nwas quite happy, and began to grow and put on fat.',\n",
       " 'TREATMENT. \"I fed him, washed his hands, face and feet twice a\\nday, and brushed and combed his hair,--which he would try to do\\nhimself whenever he got hold of the brush or comb. He soon got to\\nlike all this.',\n",
       " 'TRAINING. \"My next idea was to teach him to be strictly clean in\\nhis habits. It was my ambition to be able to have him upstairs in\\nour house as an ordinary member of the household. I taught him\\nfirst as a child is taught and handled. This took some time. At\\nfirst I could not make him understand what we expected of him,\\neven though I always petted him and gave him grapes (of which he\\nwas especially fond), but I think at first he imagined that this\\ntreatment was a punishment. At first, without other reasons, he\\nwould roll on the floor and shriek, but directly he understood\\nwhat was expected of him he soon learned, and began to behave\\nexcellently.',\n",
       " '\"This training occupied quite six weeks. About February, 1919, we\\ntook him out of his cage, and allowed him the freedom of the\\nhouse.

The\\nonly thing he stuck to was milk, which he liked best when warmed.\\nWe began by giving him a quart a day, rising to three and one-half\\nquarts a day. I found that he preferred to choose his own food, so\\nI used to prepare for him several kinds, such as bananas, oranges,\\napples, grapes, raisins, currants, dates and any small fruits in\\nseason, such as raspberries or strawberries, _all of which he\\nliked to have warmed!_',\n",

The more beautiful they were, the\\nmore he liked them, but he never would eat faded roses. He never\\ncared much for nuts of any other kind than baked peanuts, save\\nwalnuts. I found that nuts gave him dreadful spells of\\nindigestion.',\n",

       " '\\nIt was in the jungles of the Animallai Hills of southern India\\nthat I first became impressed by the mental capacity of the Indian\\nelephant. I saw many wild herds. I saw elephants at work, and at\\none period I lived in a timber camp, consisting of working\\nelephants and mahouts. I saw a shrewd young elephant-driver\\nsoundly flogged for stealing an elephant, farming it out to a\\nnative timber contractor for four days, and then elaborately\\npretending that the animal had been \"lost.\" Later on I saw\\nelephant performances in the \"Greatest Show on Earth\" and\\nelsewhere, and for eighteen years I have been chief mourner over\\nthe idiosyncrasies of Gunda and Alice. If I do not now know\\nsomething about elephants, then my own case of animal intelligence\\nis indeed hopeless.',\n",
       " 'To me it seems that the only thing necessary to establish the\\nelephant as an animal of remarkable intellect and power of\\noriginal reasoning is to set forth the unadorned facts that lie\\nready to hand.',\n",
       " 'Cuvier recorded the opinion that in sagacity the elephant in no\\nway excels the dog and some other species of carnivora. Sir\\nEmerson Tennent, even after some study of the elephant, was\\ndisposed to award the palm for intelligence to the dog, but only\\n\"from the higher degree of development consequent on his more\\nintimate domestication and association with man.\" In the mind of\\nG. P. Sanderson we fear that familiarity with the elephant bred a\\nmeasure of contempt; and this seems very strange. He says:',\n",
       " '\"Its reasoning faculties are undoubtedly far below those of the\\ndog, and possibly of other animals; and in matters beyond its\\ndaily experience it evinces no special discernment.\"',\n",
       " 'To me it seems that all three of those opinions are off the\\ntarget. The dog is not a wild, untrammeled animal; and neither\\ndogs, cats nor savage men evince any special discernment \"beyond\\nthe range of their daily experience.\" Moreover, there are some\\nmillions of tame men of whom the same may be said with entire\\nsafety.',\n",
       " 'Very often the question is asked: \"Is the African elephant equal\\nin intelligence and training capacity to the Indian species?\"',\n",
       " 'To this we must answer: Not proven. We do not know. The African\\nspecies never has been tried out on the same long and wide basis\\nas the Indian. Many individual African elephants, very\\nintelligent, have been trained, successfully, and have given good\\naccounts of themselves. For my own part I am absolutely sure that\\nwhen taken in hand at the same age, and trained on the same basis\\nas the Indian species, the African elephant will be found mentally\\nquite the equal of the Indian, and just as available for work or\\nperformances.',\n",

It is these two conditions that have left the\\nAfrican elephant far behind the procession. The African elephant\\nbelongs to the great Undeveloped Continent. He has been, and he\\nstill is, mercilessly pursued and slaughtered for his tusks. All\\nthe existing species of African elephants are going down and out\\nbefore the ivory hunters. We fear that they will all be dead one\\nhundred years from this time, or even less. A century hence, when\\nthe last _africanus_ has gone to join the mammoth and the\\nmastodon, his well protected wild congener in India still will be\\ndevouring his four hundred pounds of green fodder per day, and the\\ntame ones will be performing to amuse the swarming human millions\\nof this overcrowded world.',\n",

For my own part, I believe it would exceed a hundred.\\nThe performance in the circus-ring is limited by time and space,\\nand not by the mental capacity of the elephants.\",\n",
       " \"Comprehension under Training. When we come to consider the\\ncomparative mental receptivity and comprehension of animals under\\nman's tuition, we find the elephant absolutely unsurpassed. On\\naccount of the fact that an elephant is about eighteen years in\\ncoming to anything like maturity, according to the Indian\\nGovernment standard for working animals, it is far more economical\\nand expeditious to catch full-grown elephants in their native\\njungles, and train them, than it is to breed and rear them. About\\nninety per cent of all the elephants now living in captivity were\\ncaught in a wild state and tamed, and of the remainder at least\\neighty per cent were born in captivity of females that were gravid\\nwhen captured. It will be seen, therefore, that the elephant has\\nderived no advantage whatever from ancestral association with man,\\nand has gained nothing from the careful selection and breeding\\nwhich, all combined, have made the collie dog, the pointer and the\\nsetter the wonderfully intelligent animals they are. For many\\ngenerations the horse has been bred for strength, for speed, or\\nfor beauty of form, but the breeding of the dog has been based\\n_chiefly_ on his intelligence as a means to an end. _With\\nall his advantages, it is to be doubted whether the comprehensive\\nfaculties of the dog, even in the most exceptional individuals of\\na whole race, are equal to those of the adult wild elephant fresh\\nfrom the jungle._\",\n",
       " 'The extreme difficulty of teaching a dog _of mature age_ even\\nthe simplest thing is so well known that it has passed into a\\nproverb: \"It is hard to teach an old dog new tricks.\" In other\\nwords, the conditions _must_ be favorable. But what is the\\ncase with the elephant? The question shall be answered by G. P.\\nSanderson. In his \"Wild Beasts of India,\" he says: \"_Nor are\\nthere any elephants which can not be easily subjugated, whatever\\ntheir size or age. The largest and oldest elephants are frequently\\nthe most easily tamed, as they are less apprehensive than the\\nyounger ones._\"',\n",
       " 'Philosophy of the Elephant in Accepting Captivity and Making the\\nBest of It. The most astounding feature in the education of an\\nelephant is the suddenness of his transition from a wild and\\nlawless denizen of the forest to the quiet, plodding, good-\\ntempered, and cheerful beast of draught or burden. I call it\\nastounding, because in comparison with what could _not_ be\\ndone with other wild animals caught when adult, no other word is\\nadequate to express the difference. The average wild animal caught\\nfully grown is \"a terror,\" and so far as training is concerned,\\nperfectly impossible.',\n",
       " \"There takes place in the keddah, or pen of capture, a mighty\\nstruggle between the giant strength of the captive and the\\ningenuity of man, ably seconded by a few powerful tame elephants.\\nWhen he finds his strength utterly overcome by man's intelligence,\\nhe yields to the inevitable, and accepts the situation\\nphilosophically. Sanderson once had a narrow escape from death\\nwhile on the back of a tame elephant inside a keddah, attempting\\nto secure a wild female. She fought his elephant long and\\nviciously, with the strength and courage of despair, but finally\\nshe was overcome by superior numbers. Although her attack on\\nSanderson in the keddah was of the most murderous description, he\\nstates that her conduct after her defeat was most exemplary, and\\nshe never afterward showed any signs of ill-temper.\",\n",
       " 'Mr. Sanderson and an elephant-driver once mounted a full-grown\\nfemale elephant _on the sixth day after her capture, without\\neven the presence of a tame animal._ Sir Emerson Tennent\\nrecords an instance wherein an elephant fed from the hand on the\\nfirst night of its capture, and in a very few days evinced\\npleasure at being patted on the head. Such instances as the above\\ncan be multiplied indefinitely. To what else shall they be\\nattributed than philosophic reasoning on the part of the elephant?\\nThe orang-utan and the chimpanzee, so often put forward as his\\nintellectual superior, when captured alive at any other period\\nthan that of helpless infancy, are vicious, aggressive, and\\nintractable not only for weeks and months, but for the remainder\\nof their lives. Orangs captured when fully adult exhibit the most\\ntiger-like ferocity, and are wholly intractable.',\n",
       " 'If dogs are naturally superior to elephants in natural intellect,\\nit should be as easy to tame and educate newly-caught wild dogs or\\nwolves of mature age, as newly-caught elephants. But, so far from\\nthis being the case, it is safe to assert that it would be\\n_impossible_ to train even the most intelligent company of\\npointers, setters or collies ever got together to perform the\\nfeats accomplished with such promptness and accuracy by all\\nregularly trained work elephants.',\n",
       " \"The successful training of all elephants up to the required\\nworking point is so fully conceded in India that the market value\\nof an animal depends wholly upon its age, sex, build and the\\npresence or absence of good tusks.

One by one\\nthe orders are executed with the most human-like precision and\\nsteadiness, amounting sometimes to actual nonchalance. Human\\nbeings of the highest type scarcely could do better. To some\\nsavage races--for example, the native Australians, the Veddahs of\\nCeylon, or the Jackoons of the Malay Peninsula, I believe that\\nsuch a performance would be impossible, even under training. I do\\nnot believe their minds act with sufficient rapidity and accuracy\\nto enable a company of them to go through with such a wholly\\nartificial performance as successfully as the elephants do.',\n",
       " \"The thoughtful observer does not need to be told that the brain of\\nthe ponderous quadruped acts, as far as it goes, with the same\\nrapidity and precision as that of an intelligent man,--and this,\\ntoo, in a performance that is wholly artificial and acquired.\\nIn the performance of Bartholomew's horses, of which I once kept a\\nrecord in detail, even the most accomplished members of his troupe\\noften had to be commanded again and again before they would obey.\\nA command often was repeated for the fifth or sixth time before\\nthe desired result was obtained. I noted particularly that not one\\nof his horses,--which were the most perfectly trained of any ever\\nseen by me,--was an exception to this rule, or performed his\\ntasks with the prompt obedience and self-confidence so noticeable\\nin _each one_ of the sixteen Barnum elephants.

       " 'In the mind of the elephant, e. g., _each_ elephant, there\\nwas no confusion of ideas or lapses of memory, but, on the\\ncontrary, the mental grasp on the whole subject was so secure and\\ncomprehensive that the animal felt himself the master of the\\nsituation.',\n",
       " \"I have never yet seen a performance of trained dogs which could be\\nconsidered worthy of serious comparison with the accomplishments\\nof either performing or working elephants. In the matter of native\\neducational capacity the dog can not on any grounds be considered\\nthe rival of the elephant. The alleged mental superiority of the\\ndog is based almost wholly upon his powers of independent\\nreasoning and observation as exhibited in a state of almost\\nperfect _freedom._ Until the elephant who has grown to\\nmaturity under man's influence, is allowed the dog's freedom to\\nplan and execute, no conclusive comparison between them can be\\nmade.\",\n",
       " 'Moral Qualities of the Elephant. Finally, we come to a\\nconsideration of the elephant\\'s moral qualities that have a direct\\nbearing upon our subject. In India, excepting the professional\\n\"rogue,\" the elephant bears a spotless reputation for patience,\\namiability and obedience. The \"rogue\" is an individual afflicted\\nwith either an incorrigible disposition, or else is afflicted with\\ninsanity, either temporary or permanent. I know of no instance on\\nrecord wherein a _normal elephant_ with a _healthy mind_\\nhas been guilty of unprovoked homicide, or even of attempting it.\\nI have never heard of an elephant in India so much as kicking,\\nstriking or otherwise injuring either human beings or other\\ndomestic animals. There have been several instances, however, of\\npersons killed by elephants which were temporarily insane, or\\n\"_must,_\" and also by others permanently insane. In America\\nseveral persons have been killed in revenge for ill treatment. In\\nBrooklyn a female elephant once killed a civilian who burned her\\ntrunk with a lighted cigar. It is the misfortune but not the fault\\nof the elephant that in advanced age or by want of necessary\\nexercise, he is liable to be attacked by _must,_ or sexual\\ninsanity, during which period he is clearly irresponsible for his\\nacts.',\n",
       " 'So many men have been killed by elephants in this country that of\\nlate years the idea has been steadily gaining ground that\\nelephants are naturally ill-tempered, and vicious to a dangerous\\nextent. Under fair conditions, nothing could be farther from the\\ntruth. We have seen that in the hands of the \"gentle Hindu\" the\\nelephant is safe and reliable, and never attacks man except under\\nthe circumstances already stated. In this country, however, many\\nan elephant is at the mercy of quick-tempered and sometimes\\nrevengeful showmen, who very often do not understand the\\ntemperaments of the animals under their control, and who during\\nthe traveling season are rendered perpetually ill-tempered and\\nvindictive by reason of overwork and insufficient sleep. With such\\nmasters as these it is no wonder that occasionally an animal\\nrebels, and executes vengeance. In Minneapolis in December an\\nelephant once went on a rampage through the freezing of its ears.\\nI am quite convinced that an elephant could by ill treatment be\\ndriven to insanity, and I have no doubt that this has been done\\nmany times. Our bad elephant, Gunda, was bad by nature, but\\nfinally he became afflicted with sexual insanity, for which there\\nwas no cure. When commanded by man, the elephant will tear a\\ncriminal limb from limb, or crush him to death with his knees, or\\ngo out to battle holding a sword in his trunk. He will, when told\\nto do so, attack his kind with fury and persistence; but in the\\ncourse of many hours, and even days, spent in watching wild herds,\\nI never yet saw a single individual show any signs of impatience\\nor ill-temper toward his fellows.',\n",
       " \"It is safe to say that, thus far, not one half the elephant's\\nmental capabilities have been developed, or even understood. It\\nwould be of great interest to determine by experiment the full\\neducational capacity of this interesting quadruped. It would be\\nequally interesting to determine the limit of its reasoning\\npowers in applied mechanics. An animal that can turn a hand-organ\\nat the proper speed, or ring a telephone and go through the\\nmotions of listening with a receiver, can be taught to push a\\nsmoothing-plane invented purposely for him; but whether he would\\nlearn of himself to plane the rough surface smooth, and let the\\nsmooth ones remain untouched, is an open question.\",\n",
       " 'While it is generally fruitless and unsatisfactory to enter the\\nfield of speculation, I can not resist the temptation to assert my\\nbelief that an elephant can be taught to read written characters,\\nand also to express some of his own thoughts or states of feeling\\nin writing. It would be a perfectly simple matter to prepare\\nsuitable appliances by which the sagacious animal could hold a\\ncrayon in his trunk, and mark upon a surface adapted to his\\nconvenience. Many an elephant has been taught to make chalk-marks\\non a blackboard.

The upper panels were of heavy bar\\niron. The bottom panels, each four feet high and six feet long,\\nwere of flat steel bars woven into a basket pattern. The ends of\\nthese flat bars had been passed through narrow slots in the heavy\\nsteel frame, and firmly clinched. We would have said that no land\\nanimal smaller than an elephant could pull out one of those\\npanels.',\n",

Immediately Admiral went into a rage, on the ground\\nthat his constitutional rights had been infringed. At once he set\\nto work to recover his stolen companion. He began to test those\\npartition panels, one by one. Finally he found the one that seemed\\nto him least powerful, and he at once set to work to tear it out\\nof its frame.\",\n",
       " 'The keepers knew that he could not succeed; but he thought\\ndifferently. Hooking his short but very powerful claws into the\\nmeshes he braced backward and pulled. After a fierce struggle an\\nupper corner yielded. Then the other corner yielded; and at last\\nthe whole upper line gave way.',\n",

       " \"Then ensued a great battle. The two huge bears rose high on their\\nhind legs, fiercely struck out with their front paws, and fought\\nmouth to mouth, always aiming to grip the throat. They bit each\\nother's cheeks but no serious injuries were inflicted, and very\\nsoon by the vigorous use of pick-handles the two bear keepers\\ndrove the fighters apart.\",\n",
       " 'Case 2. Ivan\\'s Begging Scheme. Ivan came from Alaska when a small\\ncub and he has long been the star boarder at the Bear Dens. He is\\nthe most good-natured bear that we have, and he has many thoughts.\\nHaving observed the high arm motion that a keeper makes in\\nthrowing loaves of bread over the top of the nine-foot cage work,\\nIvan adopted that motion as part of his sign language when food is\\nin sight outside. He stands up high, like a man, and with his left\\narm he motions, just as the keepers do. Again and again he waves\\nhis mighty arm, coaxingly, suggestively, and it says as plain as\\nprint: \"Come on! Throw it in! Throw it!\"',\n",
       " 'If there is too much delay in the response, he motions with his\\nright paw, also, both arms working together. It is irresistible.\\nAt least 500 times has he thus appealed, and he will do it\\nwhenever a loaf of bread is held up as the price of an exhibition\\nof his sign language. Of course Ivan thought this out himself, and\\nput it into practice for a very definite purpose.',\n",
       " \"Case 3. Ivan's Invention for Cracking Beef Bones. Ivan invented a\\nscheme for cracking large beef bones, to get at the ultimate\\nmorsels of marrow. He stands erect on his hind feet, first holds\\nthe picked bone against his breast, then with his right paw he\\npoises it very carefully upon the back of his left paw. When it is\\nwell balanced he flings it about ten feet straight up into the\\nair. When it falls upon the concrete floor a sufficient number of\\ntimes it breaks, and Ivan gets his well-earned reward. This same\\nplan was pursued by Billy, another Alaskan brown bear. Case 4. A\\nBear's Ingenious Use of a Door. When Admiral is annoyed and chased\\ndisagreeably by either of his two cage-mates he runs into his\\nsleeping-den, slams the steel door shut from the inside, and thus\\nholds his tormentors completely at bay until it suits him to roll\\nthe door back again and come out. At night in winter when he goes\\nto bed he almost always shuts the door tightly from within, and\\nkeeps it closed all night. He does not believe in sleeping-\\nporches, nor wide-open windows in sleeping-quarters.\",\n",

Keeper Schmidt purchased a pair, to take the place\\nof his old black ones, but when he first wore them into the den\\nfor washing the floor the bear flew at him so quickly and so\\nsavagely that he had all he could do to make a safe exit. A second\\ntrial having resulted similarly, he gave the boots a coat of black\\npaint. But one coat was not wholly satisfactory to Admiral.

These groups must be considered separately,\\nbecause the variations in mind and temperament are quite well\\nmarked; but beyond wisdom in self-preservation, I do not regard\\nthe intelligence of wild ruminants as being really great.',\n",

This condition closes to the ruminants the\\npossibility of a long program of activities which the ruminant\\nbrain might otherwise develop. The ruminant hoof and leg is well\\ndesigned for swift and rough travel, for battles with distance,\\nsnow, ice, mud and flood, and for a certain amount of fighting,\\nbut they are inept for the higher manifestations of brain power.',\n",

Particularly\\nwas this the case in the days of the greatest bison destruction,\\nwhen a still-hunter could get \"a stand\" on a bunch of buffaloes\\nquietly grazing at the edge of the great mass, and slowly and\\nsurely shoot down each animal that attempted to lead that group\\naway from the sound of his rifle.',\n",

The\\nindividuals nearest dully wondered what it was all about. Those\\nfarthest away looked once only, and went on grazing. If an\\nexperienced old cow grew suspicious and wary, and quietly set out\\nto walk away from those mysterious noises, \"bang!\" said the\\nMystery once more, and she would be the one to fall. On this\\nmurderous plan, a lucky and experienced hunter could kill from\\ntwenty to sixty head of buffaloes, mostly cows, on a space of\\nthree or four acres. The fatal trouble was that each buffalo felt\\nthat the presence of a hundred or a thousand others feeding close\\nby was an insurance of _security_ to the individual, and so\\nthere was no stampede.',\n",
