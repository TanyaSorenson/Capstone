    "Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He\n",
    "had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his\n",
    "wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\n",
    "paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following\n",
    "manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\n",
    "suddenly addressed her with,--\n",
    "\n",
    "“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother,\n",
    "resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the\n",
    "assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces\n",
    "of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion\n",
    "of her.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do\n",
    "not depend on her serving you.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain\n",
    "herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little\n",
    "compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times\n",
    "them ill.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty, fretfully. “When\n",
    "is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“To-morrow fortnight.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till\n",
    "the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for\n",
    "she will not know him herself.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce\n",
    "Mr. Bingley to _her_.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him\n",
    "myself; how can you be so teasing?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly\n",
    "very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a\n",
    "fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after\n",
    "all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,\n",
    "as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I\n",
    "will take it on myself.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,\n",
    "nonsense!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do\n",
    "you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on\n",
    "them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,\n",
    "Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read\n",
    "great books, and make extracts.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\n",
    "\n",
    "“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.\n",
    "Bingley.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell me so before? If I\n",
    "had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on\n",
    "him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\n",
    "cannot escape the acquaintance now.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of Mrs.\n",
    "Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy\n",
    "was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the\n",
    "while.\n",
    "\n",
    "“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\n",
    "persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\n",
    "neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! And it is such a\n",
    "good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a\n",
    "word about it till now.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,\n",
    "as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was\n",
    "shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;\n",
    "or me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so\n",
    "pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but\n",
    "for your sakes we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_\n",

    "“Oh,” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\n",
    "youngest, I’m the tallest.”\n",
    "\n",
